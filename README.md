Hi besties
Heyooo
Hi ya'll we're gonna kill this project

Research question: Does money buy happiness?

Ideas:
- Make a graph with the happiest countries?
- Does the "rank" variable actually reflect overall wellness? What is the ranking variable based on?- this is based on global power index- talk about their magnetism (power to attract people, capital, enterprises.)
- Challenging the assumption that the best countries are those that are most economically successful by looking at indicators of well-being instead of just GDP/output/wealth
- Our most important variables: life expectancy, sunshine hours, hours worked
- **We need to find out how they calculated the happiness variable
- Make sure to include assumptions and mention where this analysis breaks down (ie obesity and working hours- what about desk jobs v labor jobs?)

Data additions:
- For GDP- we would have to do country GDP- we should do GDP/cap
- Cost of living- CPI? This could be good for mapping?!?!?!?!

Graph ideas:
- Joce: GDP/cap with happiness index?
- Joce: hours worked v happiness- is this related to the previous graph?
- Ana: Cost of living map?
- Cat: Plot 2 or 3 variables we picked against happiness?
- Ana: obesity has a relationship w hours worked?

Game plan
- Jocelyn will finish the map stuff- incorporate leaflet?
- Joce will work on Introduction- talk about standard of living
- Ana working on explanation for graph you made- development 
- Ana can work on data collection and different data sources
- Cat work on description for graph, write skeleton for analysis
- adding line
