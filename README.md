Hi besties
Heyooo
Hi ya'll we're gonna kill this project

link to the lens website/initial source for data: https://www.lenstore.co.uk/research/healthy-lifestyle-report/

Ideas:
- Make a graph with the happiest countries?
- Does the "rank" variable actually reflect overall wellness? What is the ranking variable based on?- this is based on global power index- talka about their magnetism (paper to attract people, capital, enterprises.)
- Challenging the assumption that the best countries are those that are most economically successful by looking at indicators of well-being instead of just GDP/output/wealth
- Out most important variables: life expectancy, sunshine hours, hours worked

Data additions:
- For GDP- we would have to do country GDP
- Cost of living- CPI? This could be good for mapping?!?!?!?!
